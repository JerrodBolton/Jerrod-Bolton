# Hello!!!!

## [Who am I ?](https://github.com/JerrodBolton)

Hey, my name is Jerrod Bolton. I hope everyone is doing well today. There isn't a lot to me, well the fact that I am a very hard worker.
I have some really big dreams; I would love to be the CEO of apple. To tell you where my journey got started was at Southwest  Tennessee Community College.
I started there the summer of graduating high school in 2019. I did this because I want education to complete my dreams before I get to be 40.
I know and understand that this is some very hard work. After going to college I was force to get a job at Walmart. Bills are sometime daunting in the way that they come at you all at once.
I stayed at Walmart for a year and six months. While working and schooling, I just failed in life, my body mined, and soul couldn’t keep up.
Therefore I dropped out of school and started at a new job. In the end this new job didn’t go as well. However I knew that was going to happen.
I stayed there until I found something that inspired me , ***The Collection Blueprint*** and ***Code Crew*** , I’m here with you all and so excited to see what’s next.
I use a MacBook Pro and the software is Big Sur
