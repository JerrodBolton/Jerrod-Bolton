<h1> What is a Markdown</h1> 
<p> I Markdown is a simple way to code on githhub. It's a way to style text on the web.<br>
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, <br>
and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. <br>
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters throwin, like # or *.<br>
