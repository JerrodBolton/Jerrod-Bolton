 ### What is Markdown 
- Markdown is a simple way to code on ***githhub***. It's a way to style text on your website.
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, 
and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters throwin, like # or *.
Your creation become magical in the image of your eyes.
